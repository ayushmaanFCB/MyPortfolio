# MyPortfolio - A portfolio website designed using ExpressJS

This is an <b><u>ExpressJS (JavaScript)</u></b> web-application integerated with <b><u>MongoDB</u></b> that I designed to showcase all the projects that I have been doing across my journey as a Computer Science(AIML) student.
The website also showcases my Personal Details, and contact Information with a Form (connected with MongoDB) for the User to contact with me.

Concepts implemented include:
- JavaScript : ExpressJS
